/* Use this contrast checker: https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ */

/* Code Along, Part 1 */

/* 1. Check the ratio of the background color and the color of the text.
    We want the ratio 4:1 or higher. What is it? 1.02 */


/* 2. Change the background color so that it contrasts well with the text. 
    What color do you think would provide a good contrast with red? 
    (Hint: Remember lighter colors contrast best with darker colors and vice versa). */

/* 3. Recheck the ratio now. It's like 4.34 Afterwards, go to the HTML file.*/
